# user.rb

## Launching the program

My program was built with Ruby (version 2.6.5). To launch the program type ```ruby user.rb``` in the terminal.

## Files included

### user.rb

This is the User class, with two methods `age`, which computes the user's age and `next_birthday`, which returns the user's next birthday.
I am aware that I'm using a magic number in the `age` method, but I'm afraid I couldn't find a way around this.
